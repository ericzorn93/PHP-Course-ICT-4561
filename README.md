# PHP-Course-ICT-4561 (Eric Zorn)

Throughout this course in my Master's degree from the University of Denver, I will be learning the fundamentals and uses of the PHP programming language and server-side scripting. We are using local web servers and database integration in the class as well in order to build dynamic server-side web applications.
